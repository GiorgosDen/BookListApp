# BookListApp
A simple application to see, add, and remove books from the list. The application is a combination of 2 projects, a frontend project (React) that provides a user interface and a backend project (NodeJS) that provides an API to contact a DataBase (built on MongoDB Atlas). 

## How prepare the project?
### Frontend
Visit BookListApp-Frontend- repository at address: https://github.com/GiorgosDen/BookListApp-Frontend-

### Backend
Visit BookListApp-Backtend- repository at address: https://github.com/GiorgosDen/BookListApp-Backend-

In total, the backend or the NodeJS project runs locally and we visit the address http://localhost:3000/, while the React project runs. You can use the React's network address like http://192.168.1.113:3000/, but must be added to the NodeJS project. 

### How to use the project?
When we open the app (React project), the book list and form appear. We have 2 options about the form, add a new book (title and author required) and delete a book (using id). In case we fill out the entire form and call a specific function by clicking a button, the App takes the required data (title and author to add the book and id to delete the book)
